"Little A has a rectangular box with a height of $h$. He places this box on a table and establishes a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system $O-xyz$, where the table is located at $z=z_0$.

Due to Little A's obsessive-compulsive disorder, he places the length and width of the box parallel to the $x$ and $y$ axes (the length does not necessarily correspond to the $x$ axis), and the bottom face has a pair of diagonal vertices located at $(u_0,v_0,z_0)$ and $(u_1,v_1,z_0)$.

Now Little A has $q$ queries. For each query, he provides a point $(x_i,y_i,z_i)$ and wants to know if the point is inside the box (the boundary is also considered inside).

"Little A has many strings, each with a character set of $\{1,2,\cdots,m\}$. He constructed a Trie for these strings and built an Aho-Corasick automaton from this Trie.

However, due to Little A's negligence, both the original strings and the constructed Aho-Corasick automaton have disappeared. Little A only remembers that the lengths of all original strings do not exceed $d$, and that the constructed Aho-Corasick automaton has $n$ vertices and a character set of $\{1,2,\cdots,m\}$.

Now, Little A wants to know how many different Aho-Corasick automatons could possibly be the one he constructed. Since the answer can be large, you only need to find the result modulo $998244353$.

The Aho-Corasick automaton is defined as follows:

1.  A Trie $T$ is a rooted tree without labels, where each edge is labeled with a character. A vertex $x$ in the Trie cannot have two child vertices $y$ and $z$ such that the edges $(x, y)$ and $(x, z)$ are labeled with the same character.
2.  Given a Trie $T$ with root $r$, for a vertex $x$, the string represented by $x$ is the concatenation of the characters on the edges from $r$ to $x$. In particular, the string represented by $r$ is the empty string. It can be proven that no two different vertices represent the same string.
3.  We say that a string $S$ exists in Trie $T$ if and only if there exists a vertex $x$ such that the string represented by $x$ is $S$.
4.  Constructing a Trie $T$ for some strings $S_1,S_2,\cdots,S_k$ means finding a Trie $T$ with the minimum number of vertices such that all strings $S_i$ exist in Trie $T$. It can be proven that such a Trie is unique when unlabeled.
5.  The fail tree $F$ of Trie $T$ is a tree with root $r$. Define $S_x$ as the string represented by vertex $x$. For a non-root vertex $x$, let $U$ be the longest proper suffix of $S_x$ (a proper suffix is one that is not equal to $S_x$) such that $U$ exists in $T$. Then, $fail_x$ is defined as the vertex such that $S_{fail_x} = U$. Note that the empty suffix of $S_x$ always exists in $T$, so $fail_x$ always exists. The edge set of $F$ is $\{(x, fail_x) | x \in [1, n], x \neq r\}$. It can be proven that these edges form a tree.
6.  Merging Trie $T$ and its fail tree $F$ means that the vertex set remains unchanged (the vertex sets of $T$ and $F$ are the same), and the edges and the characters on the edges are merged to obtain the graph, which is the Aho-Corasick automaton $A$ of Trie $T$. At this point, $A$ contains both edges labeled with characters and edges without labels.

Two Aho-Corasick automatons are considered the same if and only if they have the same number of vertices and there exist two labeling schemes for the vertices (let's assume they are two permutations of length equal to the number of vertices) such that:

1.  The roots of the two Aho-Corasick automatons are the same.
2.  For any pair of vertices $x,y$, either there is no edge between $x$ and $y$ in both Aho-Corasick automatons, or there is an edge in both and the characters on the edges are the same, or both edges do not have labels.

|||To solve this problem, we need to rearrange the characters of the string \( S \) such that the substring "CCPC" appears as many times as possible. The key is to maximize the number of "CCPC" substrings by strategically placing the characters.

### Approach
1. **Count the Characters**: First, count the number of 'C's and 'P's in the string. Since "CCPC" requires 3 'C's and 1 'P', the maximum number of "CCPC" substrings is limited by the minimum of:
   - The number of 'C's divided by 3.
   - The number of 'P's.

2. **Construct the String**: To maximize the number of "CCPC" substrings, we should arrange the characters in such a way that every group of 3 'C's is followed by a 'P'. This way, each "CCPC" substring is formed without overlapping.

3. **Calculate the Maximum Number of "CCPC" Substrings**: The maximum number of "CCPC" substrings is the minimum value between:
   - The number of 'C's divided by 3.
   - The number of 'P's.

"Little H has a permutation $P$, and he wants to split $P$ into sequence $A$ and sequence $B$.

Specifically, Little H will take several elements from $P$ in order and place them into sequence $A$, while the remaining elements will form another sequence $B$ in order.

For example, if $P = [1,2,3,4,5]$, he can split $P$ into $A = [1,3,5], B = [2,4]$.

He is very fond of increasing subsequences and decreasing subsequences. Define $f(A)$ as the length of the longest increasing subsequence of $A$, and $g(B)$ as the length of the longest decreasing subsequence of $B$. You need to tell him the maximum value of $f(A) + g(B)$.

|||To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of sequence \( A \) and the length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS) of sequence \( B \). The key insight is to find a way to split the permutation \( P \) into \( A \) and \( B \) such that this sum is maximized.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a permutation \( P \) of length \( n \).
   - We need to split \( P \) into two sequences \( A \) and \( B \) such that the sum of the LIS of \( A \) and the LDS of \( B \) is maximized.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The LIS of \( A \) and the LDS of \( B \) are related to the structure of the permutation \( P \).
   - We can think of \( A \) as a sequence of elements that form an increasing subsequence, and \( B \) as the remaining elements that form a decreasing subsequence.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - We can use dynamic programming to compute the LIS and LDS for all possible splits of \( P \).
   - Specifically, for each position \( i \) in \( P \), we can compute the LIS up to \( i \) and the LDS from \( i+1 \) to the end.
   - The sum of these two values will give us the maximum possible sum for that split.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Compute the LIS for every prefix of \( P \).
   - Compute the LDS for every suffix of \( P \).
   - For each position \( i \), the sum of the LIS up to \( i \) and the LDS from \( i+1 \) to the end will be a candidate for the maximum sum.
   - The maximum of these sums across all positions \( i \) will be the answer.

|||To solve this problem, we need to reconstruct a tree given specific information about the centroids of subtrees formed by each child of every node. The key insight is to use the properties of centroids and the given constraints to build the tree step by step.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are given a rooted tree with `n` nodes, rooted at node `1`.
   - For each node `u`, and for each of its children `v`, we are given the centroid of the subtree formed by `v` and its descendants.
   - Our task is to reconstruct the tree based on this information.

2. **Properties of Centroids**:
   - The centroid of a tree is a node such that when removed, the tree is divided into subtrees, each with at most half the number of nodes of the original tree.
   - If a tree has two centroids, they are adjacent, and one is deeper in the tree than the other.

3. **Reconstructing the Tree**:
   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to build the tree.
   - For each node, we will determine its children based on the given centroid information.
   - We will maintain a mapping from each node to its children and ensure that the centroid constraints are satisfied.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Initialize a list to store the children of each node.
   - For each node, iterate over its children and their corresponding centroids.
   - Use the centroid information to determine the parent-child relationships.
   - Ensure that the tree is built correctly by following the constraints provided.

Little A has a string that only contains the characters 0 and 1 (hereafter referred to as a 01 string). He likes 1 and dislikes 0, so in Little A's eyes, there are only 1s in a 01 string.

Specifically, for a 01 string, Little A sees 0 as a separator that divides the string into several substrings consisting entirely of 1s. For example, for a 01 string 010011101111101, Little A sees four substrings that consist only of 1s: 1, 111, 11111, and 1.

|||To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of essentially different substrings in the string obtained by concatenating the original string `s` `m` times. Given the constraints, we need an efficient approach to handle large inputs.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The charm value of a string is the number of distinct substrings it contains.
   - When we concatenate `s` `m` times, the resulting string is `s * m`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If `s` is a single character repeated `n` times (e.g., "aaa"), then the number of distinct substrings is `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - For a general string `s`, the number of distinct substrings in `s * m` can be broken down into:
     - Substrings that are entirely within a single copy of `s`.
     - Substrings that span across multiple copies of `s`.

3. **Efficient Calculation**:
   - We can use a suffix array or a suffix automaton to efficiently count the number of distinct substrings.
   - However, given the constraints, we need a more optimized approach.

4. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - We can use dynamic programming to count the number of distinct substrings.
   - Let `dp[i]` represent the number of distinct substrings ending at position `i`.
   - We can update `dp[i]` based on the previous positions and the current character.

5. **Handling Large `m`**:
   - Since `m` can be up to `10^9`, we need to find a pattern or a mathematical formula to compute the result without explicitly constructing the string.
   - If `s` is periodic, we can use the periodicity to simplify the calculation.

6. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the result can be large, we need to compute it modulo `998244353`.

|||To solve this problem, we need to efficiently compute the sum of squared greatest common divisors (GCDs) for pairs of elements from two given permutations over multiple queries. Given the constraints, a direct approach would be too slow, so we need a more optimized method.

### Approach
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Since both `a` and `b` are permutations of length `n`, each number from 1 to `n` appears exactly once in each permutation.
   - We can precompute the positions of each number in both permutations. This allows us to quickly determine the indices of any given number in `a` and `b`.

2. **GCD Squared Calculation**:
   - For each query, we need to compute the sum of `gcd^2(a_i, b_j)` for all `i` in `[l, r]` and `j` in `[L, R]`.
   - Instead of computing the GCD for each pair, we can precompute the GCD squared values for all pairs of numbers from 1 to `n` and store them in a 2D array or a hash map.

3. **Efficient Query Handling**:
   - For each query, we can iterate over the range `[l, r]` in `a` and for each `a_i`, iterate over the range `[L, R]` in `b` and sum the precomputed `gcd^2(a_i, b_j)` values.
   - To optimize further, we can use prefix sums or other data structures to quickly compute the sum over the ranges.

###_###
In the legendary magical land, there is a mysterious school. Xiao Kai is a student at this school, and recently his class is evaluating for the Excellent Student Scholarship and the Provincial Government Scholarship.

First, for each class, the allocation of Excellent Student Scholarship slots is as follows: Suppose a class has $n$ students, then at most $\lfloor{0.15n}\rfloor$ students will receive the first prize scholarship, at most $\lfloor{0.25n}\rfloor$ students will receive the second prize scholarship, and at most $\lfloor{0.35n}\rfloor$ students will receive the third prize scholarship. (For example, in a class of 21 students, 3 students will receive the first prize scholarship, 5 students will receive the second prize scholarship, and 7 students will receive the third prize scholarship.)

Each student will have scores in three areas: academic performance, moral education, and physical education, with scores being integers in the range $[0,100]$. The **comprehensive score** is the sum of the three scores. When evaluating scholarships, students will first be sorted in descending order by their comprehensive scores. If two students have the same comprehensive score, they will be sorted by their academic performance scores in descending order. If both comprehensive and academic scores are the same, they will be sorted by their names in ascending lexicographical order. The resulting ranking is referred to as the **comprehensive ranking**. The college will determine the **order of scholarship applications** based on the **comprehensive ranking**.

In addition, there is a rule that restricts the level of scholarship that students can apply for: students receiving the first prize scholarship must ensure that their **academic performance** score is in the top $25\%$ of the class, students receiving the second prize scholarship must ensure that their **academic performance** score is in the top $45\%$, and students receiving the third prize scholarship must ensure that their **academic performance** score is in the top $75\%$. (For example, in a class of 21 students, only the top 5 students in academic performance are **eligible** to receive the first prize scholarship, the top 9 students are eligible for the second prize scholarship, and the top 15 students are eligible for the third prize scholarship. **Specially**, if two students are tied for fifth place in academic performance, both are eligible to receive the first prize scholarship.)

After the Excellent Student Scholarships for the two semesters are awarded, the college will also evaluate the Provincial Government Scholarship. The college stipulates that there are only $m$ slots for the Provincial Government Scholarship in Xiao Kai's class. The evaluation method is to first sort by **award points** (where one first prize scholarship counts as 15 points, one second prize scholarship counts as 10 points, and one third prize scholarship counts as 5 points; for example, if student X receives one first prize scholarship and one second prize scholarship, their award points will be 25 points), then if the award points are the same, sort by the **total comprehensive score** in descending order, if the total comprehensive scores are the same, sort by the total **academic performance score** from both semesters in descending order, and if both total comprehensive scores and total academic performance scores are the same, sort by names in ascending lexicographical order.

Unfortunately, Xiao Kai was unable to win the Provincial Government Scholarship, which made him feel down. That night, he had a dream where he met an immortal sitting on a gourd, who could help him fulfill his wish of winning the Provincial Government Scholarship in his dream. The immortal can sell Xiao Kai several cups of drinks, where the first type of drink costs $p$ gold coins and can increase Xiao Kai's academic performance score in the first semester by 1 point, and the second type of drink costs $q$ gold coins and can increase Xiao Kai's academic performance score in the second semester by 1 point. (Note that each semester's academic performance score has a maximum limit of 100 points.)

Given that Xiao Kai's name is registered as crazyzhk, he now tells you all the scores of his class for the two semesters, and he wants to ask you how many gold coins he needs at a minimum to drink the purchased beverages and be able to win the Provincial Government Scholarship. If Xiao Kai cannot win the Provincial Government Scholarship no matter what, please output "Surely next time" (without quotes) to encourage him.

What is lexicographical order:

In simple terms, lexicographical order means "the order in which words appear in a dictionary." More accurately, the algorithm to determine the order of two different strings $S$ and $T$ composed of lowercase letters is as follows:

Let the $i$\-th character of $S$ be denoted as $S_i$.

Define that if $S$ is lexicographically less than $T$, we consider $S<T$, and if $S$ is lexicographically greater than $T$, we consider $S>T$.

-   Let $L$ be the length of the **shorter** string between $S$ and $T$. We check $S_i$ and $T_i$ for $i=1,2,\cdots,L$ in order.
-   If there exists an $i$ such that $S_i \neq T_i$, let $j$ be the smallest $i$ that satisfies this condition. Compare $S_j$ and $T_j$. If $S_j$ is lexicographically less than $T_j$, then $S<T$. Otherwise, $S>T$. The algorithm ends here.
-   If there is no $i$ such that $S_i \neq T_i$, then we compare the lengths of $S$ and $T$. If the length of $S$ is less than that of $T$, then $S<T$. If the length of $S$ is greater than that of $T$, then $S>T$. If the lengths of $S$ and $T$ are equal, then $S=T$. The algorithm ends here.

|||To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of blocks that can be used to form a rectangle under the given constraints. The blocks are of four types: A, B, C, and D. The rectangle must satisfy the following conditions:

1. Any two adjacent basic blocks must form a concave and convex structure.
2. The four edges of the formed rectangle must not have any protrusions or indentations.
3. Blocks of the same type are considered identical.

Given these constraints, we need to find the maximum number of blocks that can be used to form a rectangle.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Block Arrangement**: The blocks must be arranged in such a way that they form a rectangle without any protrusions or indentations on the edges. This implies that the blocks must fit together perfectly to form a smooth boundary.

2. **Possible Rectangle Sizes**: The rectangle can be of any size, but the most common sizes that can be formed with the given blocks are 2x2 and 3x3. We need to check if it's possible to form a rectangle of these sizes with the given number of blocks.

3. **Check for 2x2 Rectangle**:
   - A 2x2 rectangle requires 4 blocks.
   - The blocks must be arranged in such a way that they form a 2x2 grid without any gaps or overlaps.
   - We need to check if the given number of blocks can be arranged in this manner.

4. **Check for 3x3 Rectangle**:
   - A 3x3 rectangle requires 9 blocks.
   - The blocks must be arranged in a 3x3 grid without any gaps or overlaps.
   - We need to check if the given number of blocks can be arranged in this manner.

5. **General Case**:
   - For larger rectangles, the number of blocks required increases. However, given the constraints, it's unlikely that larger rectangles can be formed with the given number of blocks.
   - Therefore, we focus on 2x2 and 3x3 rectangles.

6. **Implementation**:
   - For each test case, check if it's possible to form a 2x2 rectangle.
   - If not, check if it's possible to form a 3x3 rectangle.
   - If neither is possible, output 0.

Given a tree with $n$ nodes, you can use several line segments of arbitrary lengths to cover all the edges of the tree, with the following requirements:

1.  Each edge must be covered exactly once;
2.  Each line segment must start from a leaf node and end at one of its ancestor nodes.

You can choose any number of line segments such that these segments can cover the entire tree according to the above requirements, but you need to minimize the maximum length of the segments. Your task is to find this minimum value.

For each test case, the first line contains an integer $n$ $(2 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5)$, representing the total number of nodes in the tree.

The second line contains $n-1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \ldots , p_n$ $(1 \le p_i < i)$, where $p_i$ represents the index of the parent node of node $i$.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

|||To solve this problem, we need to cover all the edges of a tree with line segments such that each edge is covered exactly once, and each line segment starts from a leaf node and ends at one of its ancestor nodes. The goal is to minimize the maximum length of these segments.

### Approach
1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list. Each node will have a list of its children.
2. **Leaf Nodes**: Identify all the leaf nodes in the tree. These are nodes with no children.
3. **Segment Length Calculation**: For each leaf node, calculate the length of the segment required to cover the path from the leaf to its ancestor. The length of a segment is the number of edges it covers.
4. **Minimize Maximum Length**: To minimize the maximum length of the segments, we need to distribute the coverage of edges as evenly as possible among the segments. This can be achieved by ensuring that no single segment covers too many edges.
